## Project Overview

Welcome to the pet store landing page project by Buntu Labs! This comprehensive tutorial will guide you through the process of creating an attractive and responsive landing page for your pet store using HTML and CSS.

## Source Code

### Step 1: HTML Code

Start by creating a basic HTML structure for your pet store. The HTML code includes essential elements such as headers, paragraphs, and images. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1. **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: Declaration specifying HTML5 as the document type.

2. **`<html lang="en">`**: Root element indicating that the page is in English.

3. **`<head>`**: Meta-information section containing character set, viewport settings, external stylesheets, and page title.

   - **`<meta charset="UTF-8">`**: Specifies the character encoding as UTF-8.
   - **`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`**: Sets viewport properties for responsive design.
   - **`<link>` elements**: Include external resources like fonts and stylesheets.
   - **`<title>`**: Sets the title of the page.

4. **`<body>`**: Main content section of the HTML document.

   - **`<header>`**: Contains the banner and navigation menu.
   - **`<nav>`**: Navigation section with the store logo, menu items, and utility icons.
   - **`<section class="hero">`**: Hero section with a title and buttons for shopping and services.
   - Other sections for shopping by pet, displaying services, store location, and footer.

5. Various elements like `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<a>`, and `<button>` are used to create lists, links, and interactive buttons. SVG elements are employed for the store logo and icons.

6. External CSS is linked using `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">` to apply additional styles.

### Step 2: CSS Code

Enhance the visual appeal of your pet store landing page by styling it with CSS. The CSS code customizes fonts, colors, layout, and other properties to create a cohesive and attractive design. Here's a breakdown of key sections:

1. **`:root`**: Defines global CSS variables for colors, box shadows, transition timings, and other values.

2. **`*`**: Applies a box-sizing rule to include padding and border in the element's total width and height.

3. **`body`**: Styles the body element, setting font, background color, and other properties. Includes responsive settings.

4. **`header`, `.banner`, `nav`**: Styles for header, banner, and navigation elements, including positioning and colors.

5. **`nav ul.navigation-menu`**: Styles for the navigation menu, specifying layout and appearance.

6. **`.card-large`, `.card-med`**: Styles for large and medium-sized cards, including box shadows, border radius, and hover effects.

7. **`.card-image`**: Styles for card images, including dimensions and border radius.

8. **`button`**: Styles for buttons, including font size, weight, padding, and border-radius. Different button styles are defined.

9. **`section`, `footer`**: Styles for sections and footer elements, including padding and positioning.

10. **`@media queries`**: Responsive design rules based on different screen sizes.
